# 🎨 Works.studio Clone – Locomotive Scroll + GSAP Project

🚀 Excited to showcase my latest project! I just completed a **clone of [Works.studio](https://works.studio)** using **Locomotive Scroll JS** for the first time, alongside **GSAP** for creative animations and transitions.

This project was an incredible learning experience — it really pushed my skills in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, especially in implementing smooth scroll interactions and animation timing.
